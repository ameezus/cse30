Description: The purpose of this (and last!) programming assignment primarily focuses on C 
systems-level programming with even more Standard C Library routines. You 
will build a limited version of the sdiff utility that we can call 
mysdiff that will implement a small subset of sdiff options 
(-d,-i,-l,-s,-w). You can supply mysdiff with any combination of two files
to compare.The purpose of this (and last!) programming assignment primarily

How to compile: make

How to run: ./mysdiff test1 test2

Normal Output: 
[cs3xyz@ieng9]:pa4$ ./mysdiff -w 60 testa testb
aaa                          -
bbb                             bbb
ccc                             ccc
ddd                          |  sss
			     +  eee

Abnormal Output:
cs3xyz@ieng9]:pa4$ ./mysdiff -W
./mysdiff: missing operand after '-W'
./mysdiff: Try './mysdiff --help' for more information.

Test: I tested the file by using testing different file contents with
each of the flags and comparing the outputs of my program to the outputs
of the public file.
